## Overview 

This project was supported by the [rOpenSci Champions Program](https://ropensci.org/blog/2024/02/15/champions-program-champions-2024/) 2023-2024, with [Andrea Gomez Vargas](https://github.com/SoyAndrea) as the main developer, [Emanuel Ciardullo](https://github.com/ECiardullo) as co-author and [Luis D. Verde Arregoitia](https://github.com/luisDVA) as the mentor. 

**arcenso** is a package under development that will allow access to the official data of the national population censuses in Argentina from the National Institute of Statistics and Census - INDEC. Currently, the results of the historical censuses of 1970, 1980, 1991, 2001, 2010 and 2022 are available in different formats through physical books, PDFs, Excel files or in REDATAM, without having a unified system or format that allows working with the data of these six census periods as a database. In addition, the presentation of the data is not homogeneous between the periods, making it difficult to make historical or serial comparisons of the available information.

This package aims to make census data available, homogenized and ready to use. It will include the census data from 1970 to 2022. Having a package of census information will allow the public and private sectors, citizens and other actors in society to access current and historical information on Argentina’s population, households and housing in a more accessible way.

> **The available data will be added to the package in stages as shown in the table below by year and geographic disaggregation. Currently, the package is in stage 1 of the roadmap.**

## Data Availability Roadmap

| Stage |  Census years                       |  Geographic level                      | Notes                           |
|-------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------|

## Installation

You can install the development version of arcenso from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
# if you do not have remotes installed

remotes::install_github("SoyAndrea/arcenso")
```

## Main functions


**arcenso** provides 

- `get_census()`: get a list with the tables currently available in the package

- `check_repository()`: reports the tables currently available in the package

- `arcenso_gui()`: shinyapp to query the available tables in the package


## Usage

First, load the library:

```{r setup}
library(arcenso)
```

### Exploring the Repository

Before downloading data, you can check which tables are available for a specific year, topic, and geographic level using `check_repository()`:

```{r exploration}
check_repository(
  year = 1970, 
  topic = "CONDICIONES HABITACIONALES", 
  geolvl = "Total del país")
```


### Accessing Census Data

Once you have identified the table you need, use `get_census()` to retrieve the data. This function returns a list containing the corresponding data frames:

```{r data-access}

# Download 1970 housing data
census_data_1970 <- get_census(
  year = 1970, 
  topic = "CONDICIONES HABITACIONALES", 
  geolvl = "Total del país"
)

# Preview the first table in the list
head(census_data_1970[[1]])
```


### Interactive Exploration (Shiny App)

The arcenso package includes a built-in interactive interface to explore and consult census tables without writing code. This is ideal for quick data discovery and browsing through historical records.

To launch the application locally, run:

```{r shiny-app, eval = FALSE}
# Launch the interactive Shiny application
arcenso_gui()
```
